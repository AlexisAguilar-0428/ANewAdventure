        <p>
            The crew are helped by the aliens to fix the ship and join the space force to help others in need.
            Everyone on the ship is now welcomed to every planet in the universe as heroes and are
            responsible for universal peace. Your abandonment of the crew leads to an even bigger
            accomplishment for them.
